A collection of MATLAB codes & raw data for "Structural dissection of human glucose transporter folding reveals evolutionary balancing between foldability and functionality
" paper, which is submitted for Nature Chemical Biology.

-HSMT : Matlab package for analysis in Magnetic Tweezers (MT) measurements\
        (for sub-codes(as in HSMT_subcodes folder), please check the comment section of HSMT.m)\
-FACS.zip : a collection of MATLAB codes for FACS data analysis\
-GLUT3_folding_dat : raw folding z-trace data of GLUT3\
 All data traces were obtained for 1.2kHz, and uploaded folding traces are before correction of bead off-center.\
 GLUT3 proteins were reconstituted in 1.3%(w/w) bicelle.\
 The % of the lipids(DMPC(PC), DMPG(PG), DMPE(PE)) indicates mol percentage.\
 If the specific mutant type is not indicated, experiments were all done with GLUT3(N43T) protein with no additional mutants.
